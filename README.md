## Instructions for cloning

- Navigate to the folder you use to store all of your projects on your own machine (in a VSCode terminal)
- Run this command to clone the repo : 

    ```git clone https://github.com/johnrearden/pa-sme-pandas-intro.git```
- Create your virtual environment - 

    ```python -m venv .venv``` (use ```python3``` if ```python``` doesn't work) 

- Activate your virtual environment - 
    - Windows : ```source .venv/Scripts/activate```
    - Mac : ```source .venv/bin/activate```

- Install your packages from requirements.txt

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Open the it_hardware.ipynb notebook. In the top right hand corner of your screen in VSCode, click Select Kernel, and then Python Environments, and then select your venv from the list.

- You should now be able to run the cells!
